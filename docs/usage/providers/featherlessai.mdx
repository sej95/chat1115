[Featherless](https://featherless.ai/) is a serverless AI inference platform. Our goal is to make all AI models available for serverless inference and weâ€™ve started with large language models (e.g. Qwen, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, RWKV). We provide inference via API to a continually expanding library of open-weight models, including the most popular models for role-playing, creative writing, coding assistance, and more.
